- Fixed incorrect link in README that leads to data.
- downloaded data from Dataverse
- discovered pip freeze to print modules,
	- though it doesn't catch them all. This one is missing 'pyperclip'
	- pyperclip needs all this extra stuff! 
- change path to point to data directory
- notebook file was poorly named and broke everything! ARG!
